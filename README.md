# ProductAPI

This is a forked version of the Markedround project which was made as a group project where i had the roles of Project owner and the only backend developer.
I had made this directory maintaining the files i had created at the given time for further improvements and future development purposes.

The project itself is a product API made in C# which can handle all the requests given from a frontend webshop.
